 1)Histogram of Math Scores

	Analysis: The dispersion of math scores is marginally skewed to the correct, with the larger part of scores falling between 60 and 80.


	The histogram appears the dispersion of math scores. The larger part of understudies score between 60 and 80, with a top around 70. The dispersion is generally typical, with a slight skew to the cleared out. This visualization permits us to see the in general dispersion of math scores and distinguish any designs or exceptions.

2)Visualization 2: Scatterplot of Math and Reading Scores

 Analysis: There's a positive relationship between math and perusing scores, showing that understudies who perform well in math moreover tend to perform well in reading.

 The scatterplot appears the relationship between math scores and reading scores. We are able see that there's a positive relationship between the two, with understudies who score higher in math too tending to score higher in perusing. The dabs are spread out reasonably equally over the chart, showing that there's no clear gathering or clustering of scores. This visualization permits us to distinguish any relationship or designs between two factors.

3)Visualization 3: Barplot of Test Preparations by Gender


 Analysis: Females are more likely to complete a test preparation course than males.

Visualization 4: Boxplot of Math Scores by Ethnicity


Analysis: There are slight differences in math scores among different ethnicities, with Group E having the highest median score and Group A having the lowest.

Visualization 5: Barplot of Parental Education by Lunch Type


Analysis: Students who receive standard lunch are more likely to have parents with higher levels of education than those who receive free/reduced lunch.
